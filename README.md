# MENTAL-HEALTH-ANALYSIS-AMONG-INDIAN-YOUTH-A-MACHINE-LEARNING-APPROACH
Mental health has emerged as one of the most critical public health concerns worldwide, particularly among young adults and students. In India, the situation has become increasingly concerning over the past decade. According to the National Mental Health Survey (2015–16), nearly 10 percent of the adult population in India suffers from mental health disorders, with young adults aged 18 to 29 identified as the most vulnerable group.
Students and young professionals are exposed to multiple stressors, including academic pressure, career uncertainty, financial challenges, interpersonal relationships, and family expectations. The rapid growth of digital technology has further intensified these issues. While technology provides easy access to information and social connectivity, excessive screen time and social media usage have been strongly associated with increased anxiety, sleep disturbances, and reduced self-esteem among youth.
The COVID-19 pandemic further aggravated mental health challenges. Prolonged isolation, disruption of academic schedules, reduced social interaction, and economic uncertainty significantly impacted students’ psychological well-being. Various studies and reports indicate that anxiety and depression levels among college students increased by nearly 30 percent during the pandemic period.
Despite increasing awareness, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding of the specific factors influencing stress and emotional disturbances among Indian youth. Traditional mental health assessment approaches rely largely on self-report surveys or clinical evaluation, which are time-consuming and often inaccessible to a large population. This highlights the need for scalable, data-driven methods to analyze and understand mental health patterns.
